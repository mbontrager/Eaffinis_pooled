Simply determine the percent of the reference genome covered by each sequencing sample

```{r input}
library(dplyr)
stats <- read.csv("MAE-smds.coverage.py.percontig", sep = "\t")
stats <- mutate(stats, bases = length * percentage_covered_sample_0 * 0.01)
a <- sum(stats$bases) / 494890867 # Divide covered bases by total genome size 
print(a)
```
